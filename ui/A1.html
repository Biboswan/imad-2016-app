   I can still recollect the days when I used to visit my dad's office with mom and play pre-installed games
   on computer at the age of around 6 or 7!! I usedto type aricles from newspapers.Obviously I knew switching
   on and shutting down the computer as well.I'm sure this wasn't common 11 years back as it is  nowadays.
   </p>
    <p>
   It was really amazing to top in computers once in six & again in class eight by just studying one day before
   the exams!!As a proof in the unit test I got as low as high in the exams.I probably failed in the subject if
   only internal marks were considered(class eight)That was the first time when I was fascinated abit towards
   the subject.
   </p>
   <p>
   Many of my seniors used to scare me about the difficulty with the introduction of programming in class nine.
   Since they termed it difficult I wanted to term  it easy.Gradually I became passinate about programming.I
   couldn't get the highest in the subject any further because some theory really sucked and there were many
   more passinate computer lovers in our class.However I can guarantee  that all of my computer projects were
   better the others ,because I used to make sure that I do something more.
   </p>
   <p>
   Therefore I am pursing computer science and aspire to be a good coder and so on. I am bunking college
   and creating my blog-app.&#x263B;
